  s.description  = <<-DESC
                    This library includes small Foundation/Cocoa/UIKit extensions. This library does not includes high-level data structure, algorithm or frameworks, but collection of code snippets.
                    * Many common snippets in a method call.
                    * Looks like native foundation methods - It follows Apple Coding Guideline and Foundation naming convention.
                    See document on [Github] (http://youknowone.github.com/FoundationExtension)

                    Try FoundationExtension for Foundation extensions.
                    For iOS, UIKitExtension is available too.
